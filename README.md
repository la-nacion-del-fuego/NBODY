Introduction:
        
        -In this excercise we'll simulate the trajectory of two masses in space and the forces that exert between them. We will increase the complexity of the exercises as well as the dimensions in which we will work.
    


Methodology:

        -First we import math and then we do the copyright
        -We start with the class "def_particle()" where we work with the particle and we define a constructor "_init_()" whitin the class
        -In the definition we do the function that will integrate the system by calculating the new position of "P." "def_integrate()".
        -After we do the method called "def_getPosition()"
        -We calculate the kinetic energy of a particle with the method "def_getkinecticEnergy()"
        -now we create the particle....."A = particle" in this class an object is being created and disappearing. Once created we add elements of speed, positioning and mass. After doing this we will give the initial conditions to our particles.
        -Then we will make prints integrating delta time "A.integrate(dt)" and we'll test in a cycle "for t in range (60)".In this step we have already programmed
        Newton's first law.
        -Now we measure the force exerted between two particles, including now Newton's second and third law.
        -We get the value of "r" (r is the distance between two particles) which is "r=âˆš2"
        -We will calculate the distance r with the "def_computer()" method in "def_integrate()"
        -We calculate the vector "U" which is the direction so as not to obtain opposing forces using the method "def_computerU"
        -Now we define and add to particle two with its elements and do the test to see if it works for the two particles. We will calculate the distance between the two particles using the Pythagorean theorem.
        !!The result will be that the particle "A" is in a corner without moving and the particle "B" is in opposite motion!!
        -To solve this we will now integrate "A" with respect to "B" in a cycle.
        -Now we will add the method "A.setdt ()" (integration time ") where we will implement delta t and then define a method" def_setdt () "where abstraction with this method will be better done.
        -Then we make changes to our "def_integrate" method with respect to object "B".
        -The cycle serves to see the movement of the particles with the passage of the iterations.
        -Now we will see theoretically if our model is correct.
        -Now we try to integrate "B" with respect to "A" and the address changes and accelerates. Now we will graph, we will start by creating a subfigure that will return the figure and the axes. The graph at the beginning will be one dimension.
        -In the integrated graph with respect to "B" we can see that the result is not very good.
        -To be able to see the change of position with respect to time we can derive asking for finite differences or we can ask the program. Adding the method "def_getVelocity ()" (here we are in the first dimension). We will make a plot of the speed integrating "by hand", before that we keep our position in "X" and then we ask for the finite difference (time vs. distance), this in the first plot, in the second plot it will be time vs speed. So far we have already obtained the derivative and with this result we see that the speed increases as it approaches "A" because it falls into a gravitational potential.
        -Now we will include / see the acceleration in the first dimension, we will start it at 0 and we will seek to calculate the acceleration including it in the model integration cycle and change it in the second plot (time vs. acceleration). Our result will be that our particle will be made to a singularity.
        -Now we will pass the three-dimensional model where we will graph the particle in three dimensions.
        -First we create a new figure and print point by point as the particles move. The results will be correct!
        -Now we will make the "A" (static) particle denser (with more mass) causing the accelerated movement to curve because it feels the force of the other particle.
